# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at <your email here>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Project maintainers will follow these steps when handling reports of unacceptable behavior:
1. Acknowledge the report.
2. Investigate the issue fairly and confidentially.
3. Decide on appropriate action (warning, temporary ban, or permanent removal from the community).
